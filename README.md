1.	State and Explain the components of a DBMS(Database Management System)
A DBMS is a software system designed to manage databases. Its main components are:
        1.	Database Engine: The core service for storing, managing, and retrieving data.
        2.	Database Schema: The structure of the database, which defines tables, relationships, and data types.
        3.	Query Processor: It interprets and executes queries in a database, usually in SQL.
        4.	Transaction Manager: Ensures that database operations are performed correctly and handles transactions.
        5.	Database Interface: Allows users and applications to interact with the database.
        6.	Data Dictionary: Stores metadata (information about data structure) for the database.
        2.	What is a relational database? Give 4 examples.
A relational database stores data in tables that are related to each other through keys. The relationships between tables are maintained through foreign keys and primary keys. Examples of relational databases:
      1.	MySQL
      2.	PostgreSQL
      3.	Microsoft SQL Server
      4.	Oracle Database
3.	State and Explain three classifications of SQL?
      1.	DDL (Data Definition Language): Used to define and manage database structure, such as CREATE, ALTER, DROP.
      2.	DML (Data Manipulation Language): Used for managing and manipulating data in the database, such as INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE.
      3.	DCL (Data Control Language): Used to control access to data, such as GRANT, REVOKE.
4.	What is the difference between a Primary Key and a Foreign Key?
      1.	Primary Key: A unique identifier for each record in a table. It cannot be NULL and must be unique within the table.
      2.	Foreign Key: A column or a set of columns that is used to create a link between two tables. It refers to the primary key in another table.
5.	What is an Entity-Relationship Diagram?
      An Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) is a visual representation of the entities in a database and the relationships between them. It helps in designing the structure of a database and shows how different           entities interact with one another.
6.	What are the advantages of relational databases?
      
      •	Data Integrity: Ensures the accuracy and consistency of data through constraints like primary keys and foreign keys.
      •	Scalability: Can handle large amounts of data and support the growth of the database over time.
      •	Flexibility: Allows complex queries and modifications.
      •	Security: Provides features like access control and data encryption to protect data.
7.	State four types of data type used to store data in tables?
        1.	INT: Used to store integer values.
        2.	VARCHAR: Used to store variable-length strings.
        3.	DATE: Used to store date values (e.g., YYYY-MM-DD).
        4.	FLOAT: Used to store floating-point numbers.
8.	What is the purpose of a database management system (DBMS)?
      The purpose of a DBMS is to efficiently manage data by:
      1.	Providing a way to store, retrieve, and manipulate data.
      2.	Ensuring data security, integrity, and consistency.
      3.	Allowing users and applications to interact with the data in a controlled environment.
      4.	Supporting multi-user access to data while maintaining consistency and handling transactions.
